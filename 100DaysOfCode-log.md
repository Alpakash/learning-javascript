### Day 6
I'll push this file so I will not kill my Github commit streak!

I did research today about if I want to stay on the Google ecosystem. I do use a lot of Google services at the moment. Such as:
- Gmail
- Google Calendar
- Google Assistant (Home)
- Chrome
- Password manager (will use a software for that in the future)
- Google Maps
- and probably more...

So I decided to do some research about privacy and how I can avoid as much tracking as possible. Main top-browsers available:

- Brave = Did a small research and check on this thread. Really insightful
	-  https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/ofnnlb/brave_browser_is_it_as_unsecure_as_the_firefox/
- Edge (Microsoft)
- Firefox (Mozzila = funded by Google)
- Safari (Apple is big on Privacy)

So for the time I will be on Windows I will use the Brave browser.

I will slowly but surely move my eco-system from Google to Apples.
Really looking forward to this upgrade in the near future.

## Day 10

Alright so, on days that I did not commit a thing but did research or spent time on learning to code I'll post just a commit in this file. I will probably make a new repo called code-research. In this text file I will then summarize what I've been studying. This way I will not break the chain and feel 'guilty'! The past few days I've configured a lot.

I now got the Brave browser working, also I will use Firefox for local development (due to that it works nicely with CSS). Also I did set-up a Password Manager (Bitwarden) and 2FA (Authy) for all my accounts. Further I did install a MacOS theme for my Windows 11 OS and also I configured the iOS 15 theme on my Android phone. Just for fun and aesthetic purposes.

Tomorrow I will put in some work in this repo and finish up the TDD tests.

## Day 11
Did put in an hour into a quick refresh with the videos in the Microsoft docs, Beginners to JavaScript series:
- JSON & Objects (Lessons 41, 42, 43 and 44)
- Promises + Async/Await (Lessons 45, 46, 47 and 48)
- npm (Lesson 50)
- Tomorrow I'll continue the TDD tests

## Day 12
*14 december 2021*

Moving this file from another repository to here. Today I'll be working again in the repo https://github.com/Alpakash/the-powerpuff-girls-es6 and implement TDD. I aim to "finish" this project today.

## Day 13
*15 december 2021*

Slept really bad therefore had a late start, therefore missed my coding-block. However I did read a lot of interesting stuff from a senior developer from Slovenia named Swizec. I'm going to read his book "Serverless Handbook" for Frontend Engineers. I dead resome articles about him today and watch some of his videos about publishing a book:

- https://swizec.com/blog/mocking-and-testing-fetch-requests-with-jest/
- https://serverlessreact.dev
- https://swizec.com/blog/why-programmers-work-at-night-2/
- https://swizec.com/blog/how-i-sponsored-my-own-genius-visa/
- https://swizec.com/blog/how-i-got-a-visa-normally-reserved-for-nobel-laureates/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1L2SgQuv6Q

So I started with reading about mocking and testing a fetch request. Then after that I ended up reading about Swizec and his wide knowledge of frontend. I signed up for his newsletter cause I think it's straight-forward and teaches valueable lessons. So that's it for today. One more day well spend. Hope to have a good rest tonight.

## Day 15
*21 december 2021*
Today I read about DX (Developer Experience), I'm checking what some criteria should be for some good docs. Going to work further in an already existing project called DocQ. https://github.com/Alpakash/docq

Removed relay from the 'start script' in the package.json. About to learn GraphQL https://graphql.org/ tomorrow and implement it into the project. Calling it a day. Tweeted (https://twitter.com/Alpakash0101/status/1473282856650780673) that I will stop with social media for now. This is because I want to have all my attention on the things that need my attention most such as coding, working-out and friends.

## Thanks for the read.

I started this project because of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. More info could be found on https://www.100daysofcode.com/

I also post the challenge process on Twitter. The 3th of December I did set my intentions:
